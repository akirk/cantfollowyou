# I can't follow you

This is the source for https://cantfollowyou.kirk.at/ which is a single-page website designed to inform people that they have their profile on a closed platform.

It allows to customize the text via the URL to personalize the URL you'd send to someone. It then suggests an alternative fediverse platform.
